# Multilayer-generators-for-power-autonomy-in-the-IoT
A detailed comparaision and the difference between the different iterations using the piezoelectric generators by using weight and not weight and finding the resonance by the beam 
Here we have the different iterations for the single layer generator. This experient will provide us with a clear view on how they differ. The multilayer generator work is in progress.
